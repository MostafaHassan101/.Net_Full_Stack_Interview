# SQL Server Interview Questions and Answers?

1. What is SQL Server?
SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is used to store and retrieve data as requested by other software applications.

2. What are the different types of backups in SQL Server?
SQL Server supports various types of backups, including full backup, differential backup, and transaction log backup.

3. What is a stored procedure?
A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit. Stored procedures can be used to improve performance, reduce network traffic, and improve security.

4. What is a primary key?
A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It must have a unique value for each row and cannot contain null values.

5. What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

6. What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them.

7. What is an index?
An index is a database object that is used to improve the performance of queries. It is a data structure that stores a sorted copy of selected columns from one or more tables.

8. What is a clustered index?
A clustered index is an index that determines the physical order of data in a table. It is created on the primary key of a table by default.

9. What is a non-clustered index?
A non-clustered index is an index that does not determine the physical order of data in a table. It is created on columns that are frequently used in queries but are not part of the primary key.

10. What is a trigger?
A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed in response to certain events, such as an insert, update, or delete operation on a table.

11. What is a view?
A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a select statement. It is stored in the database and can be used like a regular table in queries.

12. What is a cursor?
A cursor is a database object that is used to traverse the result set of a query. It is used to perform row-by-row operations on a set of data.

13. What is a deadlock?
A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need to continue. It can occur when two processes try to access the same set of resources in a different order.

14. What is a transaction?
A transaction is a set of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It is used to ensure that all changes made to the database are consistent and atomic.

15. What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?
A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index does not. A table can have only one clustered index, but it can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

16. What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot contain null values. A unique key is a column or set of columns that ensures that each row in a table has a unique value.

17. What is a transaction log?
A transaction log is a file that contains a record of all transactions that are executed on a database. It is used to ensure data consistency and to enable rollbacks in case of errors.

18. What is a data warehouse?
A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of data that is used for reporting and analysis. It is optimized for querying and analysis rather than for transaction processing.

19. What is a temp table?
A temp table is a table that is created and used for a specific task or session. It is stored in tempdb and is automatically dropped when the session or task ends.

20. What is the difference between a left join and a right join?
A left join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, while a right join returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

21. What is a cross join?
A cross join returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning it returns all possible combinations of rows from the two tables.

22. What is a subquery?
A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query.

23. What is a correlated subquery?
A correlated subquery is a subquery that is executed once for each row in the outer query. It is used to filter or join data from the outer query.

24. What is a scalar function?
A scalar function is a function that returns a single value. It can be used in a select statement, a where clause, or other parts of a query.

25. What is a table-valued function?
A table-valued function is a function that returns a table as its result. It can be used like a regular table in queries.

26. What is a user-defined function?
A user-defined function is a function that is created by a user to perform a specific task. It can be a scalar function or a table-valued function.

27. What is a common table expression (CTE)?
A common table expression is a named temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It is used to simplify complex queries and improve readability.

28. What is a query optimizer?
A query optimizer is a component of the SQL Server database engine that is responsible for creating the most efficient execution plan for a query.

29. What is a deadlock graph?
A deadlock graph is a visual representation of a deadlock situation in a database. It shows the processes and resources involved in the deadlock.

30. What is a database snapshot?
A database snapshot is a read-only, static copy of a database at a specific point in time. It is used for reporting and analysis purposes, and can be used to restore the database to a previous state if needed.


31. What is a trigger?
A trigger is a database object that is automatically executed in response to certain events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. It is used to enforce business rules or perform complex actions on data.

32. What is a full-text index?
A full-text index is an index that is used to improve the performance of text-based searches. It indexes the content of columns that contain character-based data, such as text or varchar.

33. What is the difference between a stored procedure and a function?
A stored procedure is a named set of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It can have input and output parameters, but it does not return a value. A function, on the other hand, is a named set of SQL statements that returns a value.

34. What is a data type?
A data type is a classification of data based on its characteristics. In SQL Server, data types are used to define the type of data that a column can store, such as integer, varchar, or datetime.

35. What is a collation?
A collation is a set of rules that defines how data is sorted and compared in a database. It affects the behavior of string comparison and sorting operations.

36. What is a database diagram?
A database diagram is a visual representation of the tables, relationships, and constraints in a database. It is used to understand the structure of a database and its relationships.

37. What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.

38. What is denormalization?
Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve performance. It involves combining tables or duplicating data to reduce the need for joins and improve query performance.

39. What is a database backup?
A database backup is a copy of a database that is taken at a specific point in time. It is used to restore the database to its state at the time of the backup in case of a disaster or data loss.

40. What is a restore?
A restore is the process of returning a database to a previous state using a backup. It involves copying the backup file to the server and applying it to the database.

41. What is a primary key?
A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in a table is unique.

42. What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is a column or set of columns that refers to a primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables and ensure referential integrity.

43. What is referential integrity?
Referential integrity is the property of a database that ensures that the relationships between tables are maintained correctly. It is enforced using foreign keys and ensures that data is not lost or corrupted due to incorrect relationships.

44. What is a clustered index?
A clustered index is an index that determines the physical order of the data in a table. It is used to improve the performance of queries that retrieve data based on the order of the index.

45. What is a non-clustered index?
A non-clustered index is an index that does not determine the physical order of the data in a table. It is used to improve the performance of queries that retrieve data based on the values of the indexed columns.

46. What is a query plan?
A query plan is a description of the steps that the SQL Server database engine takes to execute a query. It shows the order in which tables are accessed, the operations performed, and the indexes used.

47. What is the difference between a view and a table?
A table is a physical object that stores data in a database, while a view is a virtual table that is created from a SELECT statement. A view does not store data, but provides a way to query data from one or more tables as if they were a single table.

48. What is a transaction?
A transaction is a set of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It ensures that all changes to the database are completed successfully, or none of the changes are made.

49. What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?
A clustered index determines the physical order of the data in a table, while a non-clustered index does not. A table can have only one clustered index, but multiple non-clustered indexes.

50. What is a backup strategy?
A backup strategy is a plan for backing up a database to ensure that data is not lost due to hardware failure, natural disasters, or other causes. It includes the frequency of backups, the type of backups, and the retention period for backup files.
