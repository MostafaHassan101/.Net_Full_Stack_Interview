# Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core Interview Question and Answers?


1. What is Entity Framework (EF)?
Entity Framework (EF) is a Microsoft object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to work with relational data as domain-specific objects, eliminating the need for most of the data access code that developers usually need to write.

2. What is Entity Framework Core?
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. It is designed to work with .NET Core and .NET Standard and can be used in a wide range of applications, including desktop, mobile, and web applications.

3. What are the benefits of using Entity Framework?
Using Entity Framework provides the following benefits:

Reduces the amount of code needed to access and manipulate data
Allows developers to work with data as domain-specific objects
Provides a way to query data using LINQ
Supports transactions and concurrency
Simplifies database schema changes
Supports multiple database providers

4. What are the different components of Entity Framework?
The different components of Entity Framework are:

Object Services: provides APIs for querying, updating, and deleting data
Entity Client: a provider-independent data access API
LINQ to Entities: a language-integrated query technology that allows developers to write queries using C# or VB.NET syntax
Entity Data Model: a set of classes that represent the conceptual model of the data

5. What is Code First in Entity Framework?
Code First is an approach in Entity Framework that allows developers to define their domain model classes first, and then automatically generate the database schema based on those classes. It allows developers to work in a more object-oriented way, without having to worry about the underlying database schema.

6. What is DbContext in Entity Framework?
DbContext is a class in Entity Framework that provides a bridge between the domain model classes and the database. It is responsible for managing the database connection, tracking changes to the objects, and translating those changes into SQL commands to update the database.

7. What is Lazy Loading in Entity Framework?
Lazy Loading is a technique in Entity Framework that allows related entities to be loaded automatically when they are accessed. This means that the related data is not loaded until it is actually needed, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the database.

8. What is Eager Loading in Entity Framework?
Eager Loading is a technique in Entity Framework that allows related entities to be loaded along with the main entity, so that all the necessary data is retrieved in a single round-trip to the database. This can improve performance by reducing the number of database queries that need to be executed.

9. What is a DbSet in Entity Framework?
DbSet is a class in Entity Framework that represents a collection of entities in the database. It provides methods for querying, adding, updating, and deleting entities from the database.

10. What is a Migration in Entity Framework?
A Migration in Entity Framework is a way to manage changes to the database schema over time. It allows developers to create and apply database schema changes using code, rather than manually modifying the database schema. Migrations can be used to add or remove tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects.

11. What is the difference between Entity Framework and ADO.NET?
ADO.NET is a data access technology that provides a low-level API for interacting with databases, while Entity Framework is an ORM framework that provides a higher-level abstraction over ADO.NET. Entity Framework eliminates the need for most of the data access code that developers usually need to write by allowing them to work with data as domain-specific objects.

12. What is the difference between Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core?
Entity Framework Core is a lightweight and cross-platform version of Entity Framework that is designed to work with .NET Core and .NET Standard, while Entity Framework is designed to work with the full .NET Framework. Entity Framework Core also has a simplified API and supports a smaller set of features compared to Entity Framework.

13. What are the different ways to query data in Entity Framework?
The different ways to query data in Entity Framework are: 
LINQ to Entities
Entity SQL
Raw SQL queries

14. What is the difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable in Entity Framework?
IQueryable and IEnumerable are both used for querying data in Entity Framework, but IQueryable is more powerful because it allows queries to be executed on the database server, while IEnumerable executes the query on the client side after all the data has been retrieved from the database. This means that IQueryable can be more efficient for large datasets.

15. What is a Navigation Property in Entity Framework?
A Navigation Property is a property on an entity class that represents a relationship between two entities in the database. Navigation Properties allow developers to navigate between related entities and are used to define the relationships between entities in the Entity Data Model.

16. What is a Database Context in Entity Framework?
A Database Context is a class in Entity Framework that represents a session with the database. It is responsible for managing the database connection, tracking changes to the objects, and translating those changes into SQL commands to update the database.

17. What is Entity Framework Designer in Visual Studio?
Entity Framework Designer is a graphical tool in Visual Studio that allows developers to create Entity Data Models visually. It provides a visual representation of the database schema and allows developers to drag and drop entities, relationships, and properties to create the model.

18. What is a Concurrency Conflict in Entity Framework?
A Concurrency Conflict occurs in Entity Framework when two or more users try to update the same entity at the same time. Entity Framework provides support for detecting and resolving concurrency conflicts using optimistic concurrency.

19. What are the different types of Entity Framework Relationships?
The different types of Entity Framework Relationships are:

One-to-One
One-to-Many
Many-to-One
Many-to-Many
How do you improve performance in Entity Framework?
There are several ways to improve performance in Entity Framework, including:

Using Eager Loading instead of Lazy Loading
Using Stored Procedures or Raw SQL instead of LINQ to Entities for complex queries
Using Indexes to optimize query performance
Disabling Change Tracking for read-only scenarios
Using AsNoTracking to avoid tracking changes to entities
Using Batch Updates to reduce the number of database round-trips.

20. What is Lazy Loading in Entity Framework?
Lazy Loading is a feature in Entity Framework that allows related entities to be loaded automatically when they are accessed for the first time. This means that the related data is not loaded until it is actually needed, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that is retrieved from the database. However, Lazy Loading can also lead to performance issues if not used carefully.

21. What is Eager Loading in Entity Framework?
Eager Loading is a feature in Entity Framework that allows developers to load related entities along with the main entity in a single query. This can improve performance by reducing the number of round-trips to the database and by pre-loading the related data before it is actually needed.

22. What is Code-First Development in Entity Framework?
Code-First Development is a development approach in Entity Framework that allows developers to define their data model using C# or VB.NET code instead of using the Entity Data Model Designer. Code-First Development provides a more flexible and intuitive way to define the data model and allows developers to work with POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) entities.

23. What is a POCO class in Entity Framework?
POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) is a class in Entity Framework that does not depend on any framework-specific base classes or attributes. POCO classes are simple and clean, and can be used to represent entities in a data model. POCO classes can be used with any data access technology, including Entity Framework.

24. What is a Database Migration in Entity Framework?
Database Migration is a feature in Entity Framework that allows developers to update the database schema as the data model changes over time. Database Migration creates a script that can be used to update the database schema to match the data model. This allows developers to make changes to the data model without having to recreate the database from scratch.

25. What is Database First Development in Entity Framework?
Database First Development is a development approach in Entity Framework that allows developers to create the Entity Data Model by reverse-engineering an existing database schema. This approach is useful when working with an existing database that already has a schema defined.

26. What is Model First Development in Entity Framework?
Model First Development is a development approach in Entity Framework that allows developers to create the Entity Data Model visually using the Entity Data Model Designer. This approach is useful when starting a new project and there is no existing database schema.

27. What is an Entity Data Model in Entity Framework?
An Entity Data Model is a conceptual model in Entity Framework that represents the data model used in an application. It consists of a set of entity classes, relationships, and properties that define the structure of the data model.

28. What is Object State in Entity Framework?
Object State is a concept in Entity Framework that refers to the state of an entity object in relation to the database. The different Object States in Entity Framework are:

Unchanged
Added
Deleted
Modified
Detached

29. What is Database First Approach in Entity Framework?
Database First Approach is a development approach in Entity Framework where the developer first creates a database schema and then uses Entity Framework to generate the Entity Data Model. This approach is useful when working with an existing database that already has a schema defined.

30. What is Model Binding in Entity Framework?
Model Binding is a feature in Entity Framework that allows developers to map HTTP request data to POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) entities. This can be used to create, update, or delete entities in a database based on the data submitted by the user.

31. What is a DbContext in Entity Framework?
A DbContext is a class in Entity Framework that represents a session with the database and is responsible for communicating with the database, tracking changes to entities, and managing transactions.

32. What is an ObjectContext in Entity Framework?
An ObjectContext is a class in Entity Framework that was used in earlier versions of Entity Framework (prior to version 5). It represents a session with the database and is responsible for communicating with the database, tracking changes to entities, and managing transactions.

33. What is the difference between DbSet and DbQuery in Entity Framework?
DbSet and DbQuery are both classes in Entity Framework that represent a collection of entities in the database. The main difference between the two is that DbSet is used for entities that can be modified, while DbQuery is used for entities that cannot be modified.

34. What is the difference between AsNoTracking and AsTracking in Entity Framework?
AsNoTracking and AsTracking are methods in Entity Framework that can be used to control whether entities returned from a query are tracked by the context. AsNoTracking disables entity tracking, while AsTracking enables entity tracking.

35. What is the difference between IQueryable and IEnumerable in Entity Framework?
IQueryable and IEnumerable are both interfaces in Entity Framework that represent a collection of entities in the database. The main difference between the two is that IQueryable allows for deferred execution of queries and enables query provider support, while IEnumerable does not.

36. What is the difference between an Inner Join and a Left Outer Join in Entity Framework?
Inner Join and Left Outer Join are two types of joins that can be used in Entity Framework to combine data from two or more tables. The main difference between the two is that an Inner Join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables, while a Left Outer Join returns all the rows from the left table and only the matching rows from the right table.

37. What is a Repository Pattern in Entity Framework?
Repository Pattern is a design pattern in Entity Framework that separates the business logic of an application from the data access logic. This pattern provides a layer of abstraction between the application and the database, which makes it easier to maintain and modify the code.

38. What is a Unit of Work Pattern in Entity Framework?
Unit of Work Pattern is a design pattern in Entity Framework that groups together all the operations that need to be performed on the database within a single transaction. This pattern provides a way to manage the state of entities and their changes in a consistent manner.

39. What is Database Initialization in Entity Framework?
Database Initialization is a feature in Entity Framework that initializes the database with data and schema when the application is first run. There are several ways to initialize the database, including creating the database manually, using Code-First Migrations, or using seed data.

40. What is Lazy Loading in Entity Framework?
Lazy Loading is a feature in Entity Framework that allows related entities to be loaded on demand, only when they are needed. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the database.

41. What is Eager Loading in Entity Framework?
Eager Loading is a feature in Entity Framework that allows related entities to be loaded in a single query, rather than multiple queries. This can improve performance by reducing the number of database round trips required to retrieve data.

42. What is a Self-Referencing Table in Entity Framework?
A Self-Referencing Table is a table in Entity Framework that has a foreign key relationship with itself. This can be used to create hierarchical data structures, such as a tree or a menu.

43. What is a Many-to-Many Relationship in Entity Framework?
A Many-to-Many Relationship is a type of relationship in Entity Framework where each entity in one table can be associated with multiple entities in another table, and vice versa. This is achieved by creating a third table, called a join table, that contains foreign keys to both tables.

44. What is a One-to-One Relationship in Entity Framework?
A One-to-One Relationship is a type of relationship in Entity Framework where each entity in one table is associated with only one entity in another table, and vice versa. This is achieved by creating a foreign key relationship between the two tables.

45. What is a One-to-Many Relationship in Entity Framework?
A One-to-Many Relationship is a type of relationship in Entity Framework where each entity in one table can be associated with multiple entities in another table, but each entity in the other table can only be associated with one entity in the first table. This is achieved by creating a foreign key relationship between the two tables.

46. What is Code-First Migrations in Entity Framework?
Code-First Migrations is a feature in Entity Framework that allows developers to manage changes to the database schema by writing code instead of using SQL scripts. This can simplify the process of updating the database schema and reduce the risk of errors.

47. What is Database-First Development in Entity Framework?
Database-First Development is a development approach in Entity Framework where the database schema is designed first, and then the entities and context classes are generated automatically based on the schema. This approach is useful when working with an existing database.

48. What is Model-First Development in Entity Framework?
Model-First Development is a development approach in Entity Framework where the conceptual model is designed first, and then the database schema and code are generated automatically based on the model. This approach is useful when starting a new project and there is no existing database schema.

49. What is the difference between Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core?
Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core are both Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks for .NET applications. The main difference between the two is that Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, cross-platform version of Entity Framework that is designed to work with modern development frameworks like ASP.NET Core. It has a smaller API surface and is faster than Entity Framework, but lacks some of the features of Entity Framework, such as spatial data types and lazy loading of related data.
