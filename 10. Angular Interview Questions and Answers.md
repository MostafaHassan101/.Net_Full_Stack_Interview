Directives can be used to add or remove DOM elements, apply styling, or handle events.

100. What is an Angular module?
An Angular module is a container for a set of related components, directives, pipes, and services. Modules can be used to organize an application into distinct functional areas, making it easier to manage and maintain.

101. What is an Angular service?
An Angular service is a class that can be used to provide shared functionality or data across an application. Services are typically used to manage data access, provide authentication, or communicate with a server.

102. What is the difference between a template-driven form and a reactive form in Angular?
In Angular, a template-driven form is a form that is created and managed by the template. The form controls are created using directives in the template, and the form data is bound to the model using two-way data binding. A reactive form, on the other hand, is a form that is created and managed programmatically using the FormBuilder service. Reactive forms provide more control and flexibility over form validation and data management.

103. What is an Angular pipe operator?
The pipe operator in Angular (|) is used to chain together multiple pipes in a template. Pipes are used to transform data in a template, and the pipe operator allows multiple transformations to be applied in sequence.

104. What is a decorator in Angular?
In Angular, a decorator is a function that can be used to modify the behavior of a class or other construct. Decorators are used extensively in Angular to provide metadata about components, services, and other application elements.

105. What is the difference between ViewChild and ContentChild in Angular?
ViewChild and ContentChild are both decorators in Angular that can be used to access child elements in a component. The difference between the two is that ViewChild is used to access child elements in the template of a component, while ContentChild is used to access child elements that are projected into a component.

106. What is an Angular resolver guard?
An Angular resolver guard is a type of route guard that can be used to pre-fetch data for a route before the route is activated. Resolver guards are typically used to retrieve data from a server or other data source and make it available to a component when it is rendered.

107. What is an Angular CLI?
Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that can be used to generate, build, and test Angular applications. The CLI provides a set of commands and tools that make it easier to manage the development and deployment of an Angular application.

108. What is two-way data binding in Angular?
Two-way data binding is a feature in Angular that allows data to flow both ways between a component and its view. Changes made in the view are automatically reflected in the component, and vice versa.

109. What is interpolation in Angular?
Interpolation is a way to display dynamic data in an Angular template by embedding expressions inside double curly braces. The expressions are evaluated and the results are displayed in the template.

110. What is event binding in Angular?
Event binding is a way to handle user events such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard events in an Angular application. It allows you to bind a component's methods to the corresponding event in the view.

111. What is property binding in Angular?
Property binding is a way to set the value of a property of an HTML element in an Angular application. It allows you to bind a component's property to the corresponding property of the HTML element in the view.

112. What is ngFor in Angular?
ngFor is a directive in Angular that is used to repeat a section of HTML code based on an array or an object. It allows you to dynamically generate HTML elements based on data in a component.

113. What is ngIf in Angular?
ngIf is a directive in Angular that is used to conditionally display a section of HTML code based on a Boolean expression. It allows you to show or hide elements based on the state of a component.

114. What is a pipe in Angular?
A pipe is a way to transform data in an Angular application. Pipes are used to format, filter, and sort data before it is displayed in the view.

115. What is TestBed in Angular?
TestBed is a utility in Angular that is used to configure and create an environment for testing components and services. It allows you to test your code in isolation and with different configurations.

116. What is zone.js in Angular?
zone.js is a library used in Angular that helps manage the execution context of JavaScript code. It allows Angular to track changes to the application state and trigger change detection automatically.

117. What is a data binding in Angular?
Data binding is a mechanism in Angular that allows data to be shared between a component's code and its template. There are three types of data binding in Angular: one-way binding (from component to template), two-way binding (from component to template and vice versa), and event binding (from template to component).

118. What is the difference between ngFor and ngIf in Angular?
ngFor is a structural directive in Angular that is used to iterate over a collection and generate a template for each item in the collection. ngIf is a structural directive that is used to conditionally show or hide elements in a template based on a boolean expression.

119. What is Angular and how does it differ from AngularJS?
Angular is a framework for building web applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It is the successor to AngularJS, which is an earlier version of Angular that is based on JavaScript instead of TypeScript. Angular offers improved performance, better scalability, and a more modular architecture than AngularJS.

120. What is TypeScript and why is it used in Angular?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, classes, and other features to the language. TypeScript is used in Angular because it provides improved tooling and better code organization compared to plain JavaScript.

121. What are the different types of Angular components?
There are three types of Angular components: template-driven components, reactive components, and hybrid components. Template-driven components use the built-in Angular forms module to manage form data, reactive components use the reactive forms module to manage form data, and hybrid components use a combination of both approaches.

122. What is Angular Material?
Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular that provides a set of pre-built UI components, such as buttons, cards, and dialog boxes. It is designed to help developers build modern, responsive web applications with minimal CSS and JavaScript.

123. What is a service in Angular?
A service in Angular is a class that can be used to provide functionality to multiple components in an application. Services are typically used to encapsulate business logic, data access, or other common functionality that needs to be shared across components.

124. What is a directive in Angular?
A directive in Angular is a class that can be used to modify the behavior or appearance of elements in a template. There are two types of directives in Angular: structural directives, which modify the layout of the template, and attribute directives, which modify the behavior or appearance of individual elements.

125. What is an Angular module and how is it used?
An Angular module is a container for a set of related components, directives, pipes, and services. Modules are used to organize an application into smaller, more manageable pieces and to encapsulate functionality. Modules can be imported into other modules to share functionality across an application.

126. What is a template reference variable in Angular?
A template reference variable is a way to reference an element in a template using a variable. This can be useful for accessing the element in a component's code, or for passing the element to a directive or another component.

127. What is an Angular interceptor?
An Angular interceptor is a class that can be used to intercept HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors can be used to add headers, modify requests or responses, or handle errors in a consistent way across an application.
