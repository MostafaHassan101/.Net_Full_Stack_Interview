# Asp .net Core Web Api Interview Questions and Answers?
    

1. What is ASP.NET Core Web API?
ASP.NET Core Web API is a framework for building HTTP-based web services using the ASP.NET Core framework. It allows developers to build RESTful web APIs that can be consumed by various clients such as web, desktop, mobile, etc.

2. What are the advantages of using ASP.NET Core Web API?
Some of the advantages of using ASP.NET Core Web API include:
- Cross-platform support
- Built-in support for dependency injection
- Support for creating modular and maintainable applications
- High performance and scalability
- Flexible routing system
- Built-in support for middleware

3. What is the difference between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform, and open-source framework for building web applications, whereas ASP.NET is a legacy framework that runs only on the Windows platform. ASP.NET Core has been designed from the ground up to be modular, lightweight, and highly scalable.

4. What is middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Middleware is software components that are executed in the request-response pipeline of an ASP.NET Core Web API application. Middleware components can modify the HTTP request and response, handle exceptions, and perform other tasks such as authentication and caching.

5. What is the difference between MVC and Web API in ASP.NET Core?
MVC is a pattern for building web applications that separates the application logic into three components: Model, View, and Controller. Web API, on the other hand, is a framework for building HTTP-based web services that can be consumed by various clients. While both MVC and Web API can be used to build web applications, they have different use cases and design patterns.

6. What is the difference between HTTP GET and POST methods in Web API?
GET and POST are HTTP methods that can be used in Web API to handle HTTP requests. GET method is used to retrieve data from a server, while POST method is used to submit data to a server. In other words, GET is a read-only operation, while POST is a write operation.

7. What is dependency injection in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Dependency injection is a design pattern used in ASP.NET Core Web API to manage the dependencies between objects. It allows developers to write loosely coupled and highly maintainable code by separating the construction and use of objects.

8. What are the different types of formatters in Web API?
Web API supports several formatters, including JSON, XML, and Form URL-encoded data. These formatters are used to serialize and deserialize data between the Web API and the clients.

9. What is CORS and how to enable it in Web API?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented in modern browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain. To enable CORS in Web API, you need to add the CORS middleware to the application pipeline and configure it to allow cross-origin requests.

10. What are the different types of HTTP status codes in Web API?
Web API supports a wide range of HTTP status codes, including 2xx (Successful), 3xx (Redirection), 4xx (Client Error), and 5xx (Server Error). Some of the commonly used status codes include 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.

11. What is Swagger in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Swagger is an open-source tool that helps developers to design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web APIs. It provides a user interface for interacting with the Web API and allows developers to generate client SDKs in different programming languages.

12. What is JWT and how is it used in Web API authentication?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and secure way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in Web API applications. In Web API, JWTs can be used to authenticate users by exchanging tokens between the client and the server.

13. What is the difference between ActionResult and IActionResult in Web API?
ActionResult and IActionResult are two classes in ASP.NET Core Web API that are used to return HTTP responses from controller actions. ActionResult is an abstract class that provides a base class for other action results, such as ViewResult, JsonResult, and RedirectResult. IActionResult is an interface that defines a contract for an action result. IActionResult is more flexible than ActionResult because it allows developers to return any type of result.

14. What is the role of the Startup class in ASP.NET Core Web API?
The Startup class is a central class in an ASP.NET Core Web API application that is used to configure the application services and middleware. It contains two methods: ConfigureServices, which is used to register the services used by the application, and Configure, which is used to configure the application pipeline.

15. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Web API?
Synchronous programming is a programming model in which a program waits for a task to complete before moving on to the next task. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows a program to move on to the next task before the previous task is complete. Asynchronous programming is often used in Web API applications to improve performance and scalability.

16. What is the difference between Unit Testing and Integration Testing in Web API?
Unit Testing is a testing technique in which individual units of code are tested in isolation to ensure that they work as expected. Integration Testing, on the other hand, is a testing technique in which multiple units of code are tested together to ensure that they work correctly when integrated. In Web API, Unit Testing is often used to test individual controllers or services, while Integration Testing is used to test the application as a whole.

17. What is the difference between in-memory database and external database in Web API?
An in-memory database is a type of database that stores data in memory rather than on disk. In-memory databases are often used in Web API applications for testing or prototyping because they are fast and easy to set up. An external database, on the other hand, is a type of database that stores data on disk or in the cloud. External databases are used in production Web API applications because they are more reliable and scalable than in-memory databases.

18. What is the role of the appsettings.json file in ASP.NET Core Web API?
The appsettings.json file is a configuration file in an ASP.NET Core Web API application that is used to store configuration settings such as connection strings, application settings, and logging settings. It allows developers to configure the application without modifying the code.

19. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH methods in Web API?
PUT and PATCH are HTTP methods that can be used in Web API to update resources. PUT is used to replace the entire resource with a new representation, while PATCH is used to update the resource partially. In other words, PUT is a complete update operation, while PATCH is a partial update operation.

20. What is the difference between Map and MapWhen middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Map and MapWhen are middleware methods used to conditionally execute middleware based on the request. However, there is a key difference between the two methods.

Map is used to conditionally execute middleware based on the request path. It allows you to branch the middleware pipeline based on the request path. For example, you can use Map to execute different middleware for requests that start with /api/v1 and requests that start with /api/v2.

On the other hand, MapWhen is used to conditionally execute middleware based on arbitrary conditions. It allows you to branch the middleware pipeline based on any condition that can be evaluated at runtime, such as the request headers, query string, or any custom logic. For example, you can use MapWhen to execute different middleware for requests that contain a specific query parameter or for requests that are made by authenticated users.

In summary, Map is used for path-based conditional middleware execution, while MapWhen is used for more general conditional middleware execution based on any runtime condition.

21. What is CORS in Web API?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that allows a Web API to restrict the resources that can be accessed by clients from different domains. CORS is used to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

22. What is the difference between ApiController and Controller in ASP.NET Core Web API?
ApiController and Controller are two base classes in ASP.NET Core Web API that are used to create controller classes. ApiController is used for creating RESTful Web API controllers, while Controller is used for creating MVC controllers.

23. What is the role of the ActionFilter attribute in Web API?
The ActionFilter attribute is a built-in filter in ASP.NET Core Web API that is used to apply custom logic before and after an action method is executed. It allows developers to modify the request or response before it is sent to the client.

24. What is the difference between ModelState and Model in Web API?
ModelState and Model are two objects in ASP.NET Core Web API that are used to validate and bind incoming data. ModelState is used to store validation errors, while Model is used to store the bound data.

25. What is the difference between ApiController and HttpController in Web API?
ApiController and HttpController are two base classes in ASP.NET Web API that are used to create RESTful Web API controllers. ApiController is used in newer versions of Web API, while HttpController was used in older versions.

26. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS in Web API?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

27. What is the role of the appsettings.Development.json file in ASP.NET Core Web API?
The appsettings.Development.json file is a configuration file in an ASP.NET Core Web API application that is used to store development-specific configuration settings. It allows developers to override the default settings in the appsettings.json file for the development environment.

28. What is the difference between dependency injection and inversion of control in Web API?
Dependency injection is a design pattern in which an object's dependencies are injected into it by a framework or container, rather than being created by the object itself. Inversion of control is a broader design principle that states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but should depend on abstractions.

29. What is the role of the IActionResult interface in Web API?
The IActionResult interface is a contract for an action result in ASP.NET Core Web API. It allows developers to return different types of results from controller actions, such as ViewResult, JsonResult, and FileResult.

30. What is the difference between ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET MVC?
ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building RESTful Web APIs, while ASP.NET MVC is a framework for building web applications that follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Web API is focused on building APIs, while MVC is focused on building web applications with a user interface.

31. What is the role of middleware in Web API?
Middleware is a pipeline of components in ASP.NET Core Web API that can modify or handle requests and responses. Each middleware component in the pipeline is responsible for a specific task, such as authentication, logging, or caching.

32. What is Swagger in Web API?
Swagger is an open-source framework for documenting Web APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing APIs, as well as a machine-readable format for generating client code.

33. What is the role of the [FromBody] attribute in Web API?
The [FromBody] attribute is a parameter binding attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API that specifies that the value of a parameter should be obtained from the body of the HTTP request.

34. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH HTTP methods in Web API?
PUT is used to replace an existing resource with a new one, while PATCH is used to update an existing resource with a partial set of new data. PUT is idempotent, which means that the same PUT request can be executed multiple times without changing the result, while PATCH is not idempotent.

35. What is the role of the [HttpGet], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], and [HttpDelete] attributes in Web API?
These are HTTP method attributes in ASP.NET Core Web API that are used to specify the HTTP method that should be used to invoke a controller action. The [HttpGet] attribute is used for GET requests, the [HttpPost] attribute is used for POST requests, the [HttpPut] attribute is used for PUT requests, and the [HttpDelete] attribute is used for DELETE requests.

36. What is the role of the [ApiController] attribute in Web API?
The [ApiController] attribute is a filter attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API that indicates that a class is a controller for handling HTTP requests. It enables automatic model validation, binding source parameter inference, and problem details responses for errors.

37. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Web API?
Synchronous programming blocks the execution thread until an operation is complete, while asynchronous programming allows the execution thread to continue while an operation is in progress. Asynchronous programming can improve the scalability and responsiveness of Web API applications by allowing more requests to be processed concurrently.

38. What is the role of the ControllerBase class in Web API?
The ControllerBase class is a base class in ASP.NET Core Web API that provides common functionality for controllers, such as request validation, response formatting, and access to the HttpContext.

39. What is the role of the [Route] attribute in Web API?
The [Route] attribute is a route template attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API that is used to specify the URI template for a controller action. It allows developers to define custom routes that map to specific controller actions.

40. What is the role of the JsonSerializer in Web API?
The JsonSerializer is a built-in serialization library in ASP.NET Core Web API that is used to convert .NET objects to JSON format and vice versa. It allows Web API applications to exchange data in a standardized format that can be consumed by different platforms and languages.

41. What is the difference between ActionResult<T> and T in Web API?
ActionResult<T> is a generic class in ASP.NET Core Web API that represents the result of a controller action that returns an object of type T. It provides more flexibility in returning different types of results, such as HTTP status codes and content negotiation. T, on the other hand, is simply the return type of a controller action and does not provide any additional functionality.

42. What is content negotiation in Web API?
Content negotiation is the process of selecting the appropriate response format (e.g. JSON, XML) based on the client's request headers and the available response formats. ASP.NET Core Web API uses the Accept header in the request to determine the client's preferred format and the content negotiation middleware to select the appropriate response format.

43. What is versioning in Web API?
Versioning is the process of managing changes to an API over time by providing different versions of the API that can be accessed by different clients. ASP.NET Core Web API provides several strategies for versioning, such as URL-based versioning, query parameter-based versioning, and header-based versioning.

44. What is CORS in Web API?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that allows resources (e.g. HTTP requests) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. ASP.NET Core Web API provides built-in support for enabling CORS by configuring the appropriate middleware.

45. What is the difference between services.AddMvc() and services.AddMvcCore() in Web API?
services.AddMvc() is a method in ASP.NET Core Web API that adds all the necessary MVC services, including middleware, filters, and model binding, to the service collection. services.AddMvcCore(), on the other hand, adds only the minimal MVC services without any middleware or filters. This can be useful in scenarios where you want more control over the middleware pipeline.

46. What is model binding in Web API?
Model binding is the process of mapping incoming request data (e.g. query strings, form data, JSON payloads) to parameters or properties of a controller action method. ASP.NET Core Web API provides automatic model binding based on the name and type of the parameter, as well as custom model binding using model binder providers.

47. What is the difference between IActionResult and HttpResponseMessage in Web API?
IActionResult is an interface in ASP.NET Core Web API that represents the result of a controller action, including both the HTTP response and the content. It provides a more abstract and flexible way of returning results than using HttpResponseMessage directly. HttpResponseMessage, on the other hand, is a class that represents the HTTP response message and allows for fine-grained control over the response headers and content.

48. What is the role of the IActionFilter interface in Web API?
The IActionFilter interface is a filter interface in ASP.NET Core Web API that allows developers to add custom logic before and after a controller action method is executed. It can be used to modify the action arguments, the result of the action, or the HTTP response.

49. What is the role of the ControllerBase.OnActionExecuted method in Web API?
The OnActionExecuted method is a method in the ControllerBase class in ASP.NET Core Web API that is called after a controller action method is executed. It can be overridden in derived controller classes to perform custom logic, such as logging or error handling, after the action method is executed.

50. What is the role of the IExceptionHandler middleware in Web API?
The IExceptionHandler middleware is a middleware component in ASP.NET Core Web API that handles exceptions thrown during the processing of a request. It can be used to return custom error responses or perform other actions, such as logging, when an exception occurs.
