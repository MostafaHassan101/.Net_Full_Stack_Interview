# Design Pattern Interview Questions and Answers?
    

1. What is a design pattern?
A design pattern is a general solution to a recurring problem in software design. It provides a template for solving similar problems, reducing development time and increasing code quality.

2. What are the types of design patterns?
There are three types of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. 

3. Can you explain the creational design pattern?
The creational design pattern is used to create objects in a way that is suitable for a specific situation. It includes patterns such as Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

4. Can you explain the structural design pattern?
The structural design pattern is used to define the relationships between objects, including inheritance and composition. It includes patterns such as Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

5. Can you explain the behavioral design pattern?
The behavioral design pattern is used to manage communication between objects and to control the flow of operations in a program. It includes patterns such as Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

6. What is the Singleton pattern?
The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance.

7. What is the Factory Method pattern?
The Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

8. What is the Adapter pattern?
The Adapter pattern is a structural pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

9. What is the Observer pattern?
The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

10. What is the Strategy pattern?
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

11. What is the Decorator pattern?
The Decorator pattern is a structural pattern that attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

12. What is the Command pattern?
The Command pattern is a behavioral pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

13. What is the Iterator pattern?
The Iterator pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

14. What is the Template Method pattern?
The Template Method pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

15. What is the Proxy pattern?
The Proxy pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

16. What is the Builder pattern?
The Builder pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. 

17. What is the Facade pattern?
The Facade pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks.

18. What is the Composite pattern?
The Composite pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets
you treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

19. What is the Chain of Responsibility pattern?
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. It decouples senders and receivers of a request.

20. What is the Mediator pattern?
The Mediator pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and allows them to change their interactions independently.

21. What is the State pattern?
The State pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It decouples the behavior from the state, allowing the object to vary its behavior independently of its state.

22. What is the Memento pattern?
The Memento pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.

23. What is the Interpreter pattern?
The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It defines a representation for the grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

24. What is the Flyweight pattern?
The Flyweight pattern is a structural pattern that allows sharing of a common set of objects among multiple clients, reducing the memory footprint of an application.

25. What is the Visitor pattern?
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral pattern that separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. It allows you to add new operations to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves.

26. How do you choose a design pattern for a problem?
Choosing a design pattern involves identifying the problem, analyzing its requirements and constraints, and selecting a pattern that best fits the problem. The pattern should solve the problem efficiently, effectively, and with minimal complexity.

27. How do you implement a design pattern in code?
Implementing a design pattern involves defining the classes and interfaces required by the pattern, defining the relationships between them, and implementing the specific behavior of the pattern in code. The implementation should be designed to be flexible, reusable, and easily maintainable.

28. Can you give an example of a real-world scenario where you would use a design pattern?
An example of a real-world scenario where you would use a design pattern is in a mobile application that requires communication with a server. You could use the Singleton pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of the communication module, the Factory Method pattern to create the appropriate communication object for different types of requests, and the Observer pattern to notify the user interface when a response is received.

29. What is the Template Method pattern?
The Template Method pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

30. What is the Strategy pattern?
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows you to change the algorithm used by an object at runtime.

31. What is the Command pattern?
The Command pattern is a behavioral pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

32. What is the Observer pattern?
The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

33. What is the Decorator pattern?
The Decorator pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

34. What is the Adapter pattern?
The Adapter pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by converting the interface of one object into another that the client expects.

35. What is the Proxy pattern?
The Proxy pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

36. What is the Facade pattern?
The Facade pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.

37. What is the Singleton pattern?
The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance.

38. What is the Factory Method pattern?
The Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by deferring object creation to subclasses.

39. What is the Abstract Factory pattern?
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It promotes loose coupling by abstracting the process of object creation.
